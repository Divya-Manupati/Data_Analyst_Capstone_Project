Title: "Predictive Modeling for Heart Attacks: Exploring Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors."

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of deaths globally. To identify the causes and develop a system to 
predict potential heart attacks in an effective manner is necessary. The data presented has all the information about relevant 
factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health. The data needs to be studied in detail for further analysis.

There is one dataset data that has 14 attributes with more than 4000 data points.

We are required to determine and examine the factors that play a significant role in increasing the rate of heart attacks. Also, use 
the findings to create and predict a model.

The project aims to analyze a dataset related to cardiovascular diseases and develop a predictive model for heart attacks.
The following tasks are outlined:

Week 1:

1. Preliminary data inspection: The data will be examined to understand its structure, identify missing values, duplicates,
and other characteristics.
2. Data cleaning: Duplicates will be removed, and missing values will be treated using an appropriate strategy, such as
imputation or removal.
3. Statistical summary: A preliminary analysis will be performed to calculate measures of central tendencies (mean, median, mode)
and explore the spread of the data (variance, standard deviation).
4. Categorical variables: Data variables that are likely categorical in nature will be identified. These variables will be explored 
using appropriate tools, such as count plots, to understand their distribution.
5. Occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) across different ages: The relationship between age and the occurrence of CVD will be 
studied to identify any trends or patterns.
6. Composition of patients by gender: The distribution of patients with respect to gender will be examined to understand the gender 
representation in the dataset.

Week 2:

1. Relationship between cholesterol levels and the target variable: The relationship between cholesterol levels and the occurrence 
of heart attacks will be described and analyzed to determine any correlations.
2. Relationship between peak exercising and heart attack occurrence: The association between the peak exercising level and the 
occurrence of heart attacks will be explored to identify any potential patterns or dependencies.
3. Thalassemia as a major cause of CVD and other contributing factors: The impact of thalassemia and other factors on the occurrence 
of CVD will be investigated to determine their significance.
4. Pair plot analysis: A pair plot will be used to visualize the relationships between all the given variables, providing insights 
into potential correlations or associations.
5. Logistic regression modeling: A baseline logistic regression model will be built to predict the occurrence of heart attacks 
using the available data. The model's performance will be evaluated using a confusion matrix.

Dashboarding:

1. Variables associated with diseased and healthy individuals will be visualized using Tableau to create an interactive 
dashboard. The relationships between variables and factors contributing to heart health will be demonstrated, allowing 
for a comprehensive understanding of the data.
2. Throughout the project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be employed to gain insights into the dataset 
and facilitate the development of the predictive model for heart attacks.
